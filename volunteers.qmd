## Volunteers

We are seeking volunteers to serve as judges or mentors for the event.

  - **Mentors** are present during the work hours to interact with groups and answer questions that arise. To be a mentor, no technical expertise is required. Mentors should feel empowered to offer technical advice if they so choose, but are primarily there to facilitate discussion among participants. 
  - **Judges** will watch presentations on Sunday (from 11:00 am - 1:00 pm) and help award prizes; again, no technical expertise is required. 
  
If you are interested in participating as either a judge or mentor, please use the Google sheet below to sign-up for times.
